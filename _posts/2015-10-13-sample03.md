# The transit dimension

Trains and buses are cool. They free your attention. When you ride, you experience the environment at a human scale. The best routes travel through space on dedicated rights of way, avoiding the tedium and frustration of traffic. Transit is also dynamic, comprised of many thousands of vehicles moving according to complex schedules. A transit map needs a time dimension to reveal hidden networks of speed, frequency, and service. At Transit.land, we have built a Transit Schedule API, a new resource to power routing applications, transit visualizations, and other wonderful tools we hope will be realized with community vision.



# Ten million tiny movements

Open transit data comes from a variety of sources, most commonly using the [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference?hl=en) developed by [TriMet](http://trimet.org/) and Google in 2005. This collaboration created a versatile specification, balanced between the needs of transit agencies and data consumers. GTFS describes a transit system as a number of routes, stops, and trips that individual transit vehicles make according to a set schedule. The format has added many features and extensions over the years, but the core specification is remarkably resilient, and has been widely adopted by hundreds of transit agencies across the world.

In GTFS, a `route` is an abstract entity that groups together many similar `trips`. Each `trip` begins at a `stop`, then visits another `stop`, and so on and on, until the trip ends at a final `stop`. Each stop visit includes an arrival time, a departure time, and various other attributes. This point-to-point representation is intuitive, and easy to describe as a series of rows in a CSV file or relational database.

However, there are other useful ways to think about a transit schedule. Fundamentally, transit is about moving from stop to stop, and any two stops may have many possible connections -- through different routes, at different times of day, using modified schedules on weekends and holidays, and so on. The Transit.land Schedule API transforms GTFS schedule data into a set of connections between stops, representing the transit network as a large directed graph.

This schedule model allows the data to be easily searched and partitioned geographically. For instance, you can request only the schedule data within a geographic region. Or, schedule data for a given day, or time of day, or a specified time period. Fine-grained access to schedule data frees you from having to download, parse, and manage many different GTFS schedules (each of which can be very large with millions of rows) and instead focus on the data most relevant to your application.



# Transit.land Schedule API

The [Transit.land Schedule API endpoint](http://dev.transit.land/api/v1/schedule_stop_pairs) returns stop-stop edges, called `ScheduleStopPairs`, and supports a number of filtering parameters. Each `ScheduleStopPair` includes an origin stop, a destination stop, a route, an operator, arrival and departure times, the service calendar for the edge, as well as properties about accessibility, time-point certainty, etc. Routes, stops, and operators are referenced by their [Onestop ID](https://github.com/transitland/onestop-id-scheme/blob/master/introduction.md). Additional documentation is available in the [Transit.land Datastore Github repository](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-datastore/blob/master/doc/schedule_api.md)

# Frequency is freedom

[Jarrett Walker](http://www.humantransit.org/frequent-networks/) and many others believe that one of the most important properties of a useful transit network is the frequency of service, as experienced by how long a rider must wait on average for a transit vehicle. Frequent service is the foundation of a robust transit network, and critical for rider trust. Yet, frequency information is often [missing or obscured](https://www.sfmta.com/projects-planning/projects/new-muni-map) on official transit maps, or [manually drawn by enthusiasts](http://calurbanist.com/east-bay-frequent-transit/) to fill the gap. A GTFS schedule contains all the data necessary to create a frequent service map, but regional transit service is often split among many agencies and multiple GTFS feeds.


The Transit.land Schedule API provides a simpler method to access and analyze the data for a frequent service map. Data for all agencies is available through the same service, and the graph format makes it easy to measure the level of service between any two stops. The [simple Python script]() that generated the above map (created as a [GeoJSON file]()) provides a working example of the Schedule API.

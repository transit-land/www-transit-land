**Transitland Feed Registry** is a directory of public-transit operators and their authoritative data feeds. The directory is a view into [Transitland's Datastore API](/how-it-works/datastore/). It lets users browse operators and their feeds, as well as view the license restrictions on each feed and contribute additional operators and feeds.

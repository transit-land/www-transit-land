title: Feeds and feed versions
layout: documentation
---

Transitland is built on publicly available GTFS data [contributed](/documentation/feed-registry/add-a-feed.html) by our user community. Detailed information is kept on each Feed, and updated whenever a new version of each Feed is discovered. Feed versions are both archived for download (as `.zip` files) and imported into the Transitland Datastore for API querying by operators, stops, [routes](routes-and-route-stop-patterns.html), [schedules](schedules.html), etc.

## Feeds

A Feed represents a unique GTFS data source. Each Feed has a URL to a publicly accessible GTFS archive, a mapping of GTFS `agency_id` values to Transitland Operators, the geographic extent of the Feed, and the details of the Feed's license.

### Feed data model

### Feeds API

Endpoint: `/api/v1/feeds`

<a name="feed-license-information"></a>

### Feed license information

To learn more about how Transitland classifies the licenses associated with a feed, see [this overview of Transitland legal and licensing issues](/an-open-project/index.html).

## Feed versions

Approximately once per day, the URL for each Feed is checked. When a new version of the Feed is found, a Feed Version is created. The ID for each Feed Version is the [SHA1 checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) of the GTFS archive.

### Feed versions data model

### Feed versions API

Endpoint: `/api/v1/feed_versions`

<a name="active-feed-version"></a>

### Active feed version

The most recent version of a feed that has been imported into the Transitland Datastore is marked as active. The [schedule API endpoint](schedules.html) only allows querying of the trips and calendars in the active feed version.

The [FeedMaintenance service](https://github.com/transitland/transitland-datastore/blob/master/app/services/feed_maintenance_service.rb) within Transitland Datastore automatically decides when to import a newly fetched feed version. If no need feed version is available when existing ScheduleStopPairs are about to expire, the FeedMaintenance service will extend them into the future.

### Most recent feed version

Are you looking for the most recently fetched Feed Version? This is not necessarily the Feed Version where `is_active_feed_version=true`.

To query for the most recently fetched version of a feed, use an API query like: `https://transit.land/api/v1/feed_versions?feed_onestop_id=f-9v6-capitalmetro&per_page=1&sort_key=fetched_at&sort_order=desc` (replacing `feed_onestop_id` as appropriate).

To directly download a copy of the most recently fetched version of a feed, use: `https://transit.land/api/v1/feeds/f-9v6-capitalmetro/download_latest_feed_version` (replacing the Onestop ID as appropriate). Note that downloading is not allowed for Feeds where `license_redistribute=no`.

### Feed version reports

The Transitland Datastore creates a number of validation and statistical reports for each Feed Version. The currently defined types of reports are:

- `FeedVersionInfoStatistics`: General statistics
- `FeedVersionInfoConveyalValidation`: [Conveyal gtfs-lib](https://github.com/conveyal/gtfs-lib) validation results

Additionally, the results of [Google's feedvalidator.py](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/FeedValidator) HTML output will be stored on the Feed Version as `feedvalidator_url` when available. In the future, this may instead be stored as an additional type of report.

### Feed version report data model

| `type`                | Enum         | Report type                       |
| `feed_version_sha1`   | Feed Version | Parent Feed Version               |
| `feed_onestop_id`     | Onestop ID   | Parent Feed                       |
| `data`                | JSON         | JSON blob containing report data  |

| Query parameter        | Type | Description | Example |
|------------------------|------|-------------|---------|
| `feed_onestop_id`    | Onestop ID | Filter by Feed | [Caltrain](https://transit.land/api/v1/feed_version_infos/?feed_onestop_id=f-9q9-caltrain) |
| `feed_version_sha1`  | Feed Version | Filter by Feed Version | [Caltrain, single Feed Version](https://transit.land/api/v1/feed_version_infos?feed_version_sha1=36ba71b654ba6ed1e4866822832c11942c4761e5) |
| `type`                 | Enum | Filter by report type | [Caltrain statistics](https://transit.land/api/v1/feed_version_infos/?feed_onestop_id=f-9q9-caltrain&type=FeedVersionInfoStatistics) |

### FeedVersionInfoStatistics reports

This report contains details about the files in the GTFS archive and basic statistics about the CSV columns and values.

- `filenames`: The filenames present in the directory of the archive containing the CSV files.
- `statistics`: Data for each GTFS CSV file and column, with the `total` number of rows with data for that column, the `unique` number of values encountered, as well as the `min` and `max` values.
- `scheduled_service`: Key-value data for the number of seconds of scheduled service for each date the Feed has scheduled trips.

[Example FeedVersionInfoStatistics  report](https://transit.land/api/v1/feed_version_infos/845)

### FeedVersionInfoConveyalValidation reports

This report contains the JSON output of [Conveyal's gtfs-lib](https://github.com/conveyal/gtfs-lib) validator.

[Example FeedVersionInfoConveyalValidation report](https://transit.land/api/v1/feed_version_infos/8115)

### Google feedvalidator.py reports

The HTML output of [Google feedvalidator.py](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/FeedValidator). Currently, this is stored on the actual Feed Version record as `feedvalidator_url` as a link to a copy of the report stored on S3.

[Example Feed Version with Google feedvalidator.py report](https://transit.land/api/v1/feed_versions/36ba71b654ba6ed1e4866822832c11942c4761e5)
